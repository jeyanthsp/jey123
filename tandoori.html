    <h1>Tandoori chicken</h1>
    <p>
        Tandoori chicken, a culinary gem hailing from the Indian subcontinent, is a dish that embodies the rich heritage and vibrant flavors of Indian cuisine. Marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper, this chicken is then traditionally cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven that imparts a unique smoky flavor and charred aroma. The result is succulent, tender chicken with a tantalizing balance of spices, perfect for igniting the taste buds and transporting diners on a flavorful journey. Tandoori chicken is not just a dish; it's a celebration of tradition, craftsmanship, and the artistry of Indian culinary mastery.</p>
