    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Full Chicken</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Preheat the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 375-400°F or 190-200°C). Make sure the grill grates are clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare the Chicken: If using boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, trim any excess fat and pat them dry with paper towels. This helps the chicken cook more evenly and promotes better browning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Season or Marinate: Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. If using a marinade, place the chicken in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Cover or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight, allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Oil the Grill Grates: Once the grill is preheated, use tongs and a folded paper towel dipped in oil to lightly oil the grill grates. This helps prevent sticking and promotes attractive grill marks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the Chicken on the Grill: Place the chicken pieces on the preheated grill. If you're grilling bone-in pieces, such as chicken thighs or drumsticks, place them on the grill skin-side down first.

       </ul>
